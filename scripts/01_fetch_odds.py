"""
Fetch NFL odds from The Odds API.

This script does TWO passes:
  1) Featured markets (h2h/spreads/totals) via /sports/{sport}/odds
  2) Player props via per-event endpoint /sports/{sport}/events and then
     /sports/{sport}/events/{eventId}/odds?markets=...

Writes:
  - data/odds/raw/featured_raw_<UTCSTAMP>.json
  - data/odds/processed/featured_<UTCSTAMP>.csv
  - data/odds/raw/player_raw_<UTCSTAMP>.json       (one big JSON of all events)
  - data/odds/processed/player_<UTCSTAMP>.csv
  - data/props/props_current.csv                   (normalized superset)

Environment variables (set from workflow):
  ODDS_API_KEY           (required for live calls)
  ODDS_FEATURED_MARKETS  (default: "h2h,spreads,totals")
  ODDS_PLAYER_MARKETS    (comma list of player_* keys)
  ODDS_REGIONS           (default: "us")
  ODDS_BOOKMAKERS        (optional; comma list)
  ODDS_ODDS_FORMAT       (default: "american")
  ODDS_DATE_FORMAT       (default: "iso")
  TARGET_SEASON          (default: current UTC year; used in props_current.csv)
  DRY_RUN                ("1" to simulate without API)

Notes:
- We normalize player prop market keys to your internal market names used by
  scripts/02_build_features.py (e.g., player_pass_yds -> qb_passing_yards).
- We only record Over/Under prices when present; others become NaN.
